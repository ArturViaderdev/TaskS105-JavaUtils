# Task S105 - Java Utils

## Exercise 1

I developed a class that reads the files and folders inside a directory and show the result by console ordered alphabetically.

I build a method that reads a folder recursively, shows the results ordered alphabetically, shows the last modified date and detects what is a file and what is a folder.

## Exercise 3

I made that the results of exploring a directory recursively are written to a file.
